### [Video Demo Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aNVrEzeoBUMxTywiJEk0vOV1PZylieS/view)

## User Story

AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

## Technology Used:
- MYSQL
- mysql2 npm
- inquirer npm
- console.table npm

## App description
In this assignment, I was tasked with creating an employee tracker database using MYSQL as well as the inquirer question prompt npm.  The app starts off with a list of options for the user to select pertaining to managing a database of employees.

Each option is associated with a function the server.js file, and the results of each option are immediately displayed in the terminal:

## Installation
To install this app, the employer must install the various npms in the package.js file by running npm i in the command line, and then run 'npm start' in the command line.

## Future development:
This project is still incomplete as the optional "delete employee" function is still not written.  I intend to get to return to this in the next couple of weeks.
